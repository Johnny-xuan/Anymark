### r/chrome

**Title:** I built an AI Agent for Chrome bookmarks - talk to it like a human

**Post:**
```
Hey r/chrome!

I've been frustrated with bookmark management for years. Hundreds of bookmarks, can never find what I need.

So I built AnyMark - a Chrome extension with an AI Agent that understands natural language.

Instead of clicking through folders, you just say:
- "Find my React tutorials"
- "Organize all my dev resources"
- "What's trending on GitHub?"

**Key features:**
- 💬 AI Agent that executes tasks (not just search)
- ⌨️ Vim-style shortcuts (j/k/s/d)
- 🔐 100% local storage - your data never leaves your browser
- 🔑 Use your own API keys (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) or free local analysis
- 🆓 Completely free and open-source

**Links:**
- Chrome Web Store: [link]
- GitHub: [link]

Would love to hear your feedback!

### r/SideProject

**Title:** After 3 months of building, I'm launching AnyMark - The First Bookmark AI Agent

**Post:**
```
Hey everyone!

Just launched my side project: AnyMark - a Chrome extension that lets you manage bookmarks by talking to an AI Agent.

**The problem:** I had 500+ bookmarks and could never find anything.

**The solution:** An AI that understands "find that Python tutorial from last week" and actually finds it.

**Tech stack:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for building
- Zustand for state
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- OpenAI-compatible API

**What makes it different:**
- It's an Agent, not just a chatbot - it executes actions
- Vim-style keyboard shortcuts for power users
- 100% local storage - privacy first
- Works with any OpenAI-compatible API (or free local analysis)

**Links:**
- Chrome Store: [link]
- GitHub: [link]

Feedback welcome! 🙏

### r/webdev

**Title:** Open-sourcing my Chrome extension: AI-powered bookmark manager with React + TypeScript

**Post:**
```
Built this over the past few months and decided to open-source it.

**AnyMark** - A bookmark manager with an AI Agent

**Tech highlights:**
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Zustand for state management
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- IndexedDB for large collections
- i18n support (6 languages)
- Vim-style keyboard navigation

**Architecture:**
- Agent loop: Intent → Execute → Feedback
- Tool registry system for extensibility
- Real-time Chrome bookmark sync

**What I learned:**
- Chrome Extension MV3 is tricky but doable
- Side panel API is great for productivity tools
- IndexedDB beats localStorage for large datasets

GitHub: [link]

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

### r/artificial

**Title:** Built an AI Agent for browser bookmarks - it actually executes tasks, not just answers questions

**Post:**
```
Most AI integrations are just chatbots. I wanted something that actually does work.

So I built AnyMark - a Chrome extension where the AI Agent:
- Searches your bookmarks
- Organizes them into folders
- Finds trending resources online
- Cleans up unused bookmarks

You just talk to it naturally: "Find my React tutorials" or "Organize my dev resources"

It uses an Agent loop:
1. Understand intent
2. Execute action (search, organize, etc.)
3. Report results

Works with OpenAI, Claude, or local models via Ollama.

100% open-source: [GitHub link]

Curious what other Agent use cases people are building?

**First Comment:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built AnyMark because I was frustrated with bookmark management. 500+ bookmarks, could never find what I needed.

The key insight: bookmarks need a librarian, not a better filing system.

So I built an AI Agent that understands natural language and actually executes tasks - searching, organizing, discovering new resources.

It's 100% free and open-source. Your data stays local. Use your own API keys or the free local analysis.

Would love your feedback! 🙏
